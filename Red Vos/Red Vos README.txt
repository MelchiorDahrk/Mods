Red Vos
========
by Tyddyner and Melchior Dahrk
v2.0


Description
=======================
This mod gives the farming village of Vos a unique, reddish texture to complement the region. This changes both the interior and exterior areas of the village.


Installation
=======================
Simply copy the contents of "00 Core" into your Data Files folder and activate "Red Vos.ESP"


Patches
========
If you use Glow in the Dahrk (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886), then install the contents of "1-Glow in the Dahrk Patch" to your Data Files folder. No ESP required! The script in GITD will use the included meshes automatically!


If -for some reason- you still use Windows Glow, you will need to use the "Windows Glow_Red Vos.ESP" plugin in the Compatibility Patches folder. This plugin should be used INSTEAD of "Windows Glow.esp" AND "Red Vos.esp". Due to the nature of Windows Glow, a simple patch was not possible beyond using external programs.

If -for some other reason- you still use Windoors Glow, you will need to use the "RR_Windoors_Glow_1C & Red Vos.esp" plugin in the Compatibility Patches folder. This plugin should be used INSTEAD of "RR_Windoors_Glow_1C.esp" AND "Red Vos.esp". Due to the nature of Windoors Glow, a simple patch was not possible beyond using external programs.

If -for some ungodly reason- you use Red Vos, White Suran 2, AND Windows/Windoors Glow, then download the combined patch from Dahrk Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43528?).

Do you see why you should be using Glow in the Dahrk yet? No more crazy patches!!


Compatibility
=======================
Red Vos is NOT compatible with OAAB Grazelands. If someone else wants to make a patch, please feel free to send it my way.


Credits
=======================
Tyddyner did the texture work, I did the CS and Mesh work


Usage
=======================
The plugin is free to use/alter/upload. But the textures are owned by Tyddyner and are not free to use without permission.
