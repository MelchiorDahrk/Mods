White Suran 2 - MD Edition
==========================
by Melchior Dahrk & basswalker
v4.2

=======================
Description
=======================
Suran is the "Pearl of the Ascadian Isles," the "Lady of the Nabia." So it just makes sense that Suran should feature glistening whitewashed walls. That's what this mod does.

As of version 4.0+, this mod is OpenMW ONLY. This version is now dependent on Static Switching System which uses a script to automatically replace references in individual games. This technique does not currently work in MGE XE due to Distant Land constraints. MGE XE / vanilla users can install older versions, but patches will not be officially supported moving forward. The good news is that, for OpenMW players and modders, the days of needing to patch every single mod touching Suran are over!

Features:
* Automatically replaces all supported meshes in Suran with new textures
* Includes atlased meshes to improve performance
* Homogenizes texture resolution for smoother graphical experience
* Provides matching ground texture (optional)
* Provides support for Glow in the Dahrk
* HD textures (optional)

=======================
Installation
=======================

Mod comes with a fomod installer for Mod Organizer 2 users. Mod archive is BAIN compatible - see folder explanations below if you are installing with Wrye Mash. For a manual installation, simply copy the files you want into your Data Files folder.

Wrye Mash
Installation
==============

---00 Core
Required files

---01 Ground Textures
Replaces the ground textures of Suran with white textures matching the rest of Suran. This is accomplished by editing the landscape so this will be incompatible with any mod which makes landscape edits to Suran.

---02 Glow in the Dahrk
If you use Glow in the Dahrk, this patch will make the windows and temple windows turn on and off properly.

---03 HD Textures
Increases the texture resolution to 4x vanilla.

=======================
Compatibility
=======================
Version 4.0 and later is not compatible with MGE XE or vanilla.

The optional ground texture addon is incompatible with any mods which alter the landscape of Suran.

If you encounter a mesh which has not been replaced in a mod, let me know so that support can be added.
