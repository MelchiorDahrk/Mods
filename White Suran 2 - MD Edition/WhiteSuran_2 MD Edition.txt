White Suran 2 - MD Edition
==========================
by Melchior Dahrk & basswalker
v3.4


=======================
Description
=======================
Suran is the "Pearl of the Ascadian Isles," the "Lady of the Nabia." So it just makes sense that Suran should feature glistening whitewashed walls. That's what this mod does.

Replaces exterior and interior architecture in Suran with new textures
Includes atlased meshes to improve performance
Fixes some object placement to avoid reverting fixes in Patch for Purists
Homogenizes texture resolution for smoother graphical experience
Provides matching ground texture
Compatible with Glow in the Dahrk
Patch for Vurt's Ascadian Isles II
Patch for Suran Underworld
Patch for City of Balmora


=======================
Installation
=======================

Mod comes with a fomod installer for Mod Organizer 2 users. Mod archive is BAIN compatible - see folder explanations below if you are installing with Wrye Mash. For a manual installation, simply copy the files you want into your Data Files folder.

Required files

---01 City of Balmora Patch
This patch was created by StaticNation for Praedator & EnvyDeveloper's City of Balmora - Hlaalu Expansion mod which greatly expands Suran. If you use CoB, activate City of Balmora.ESP to make all of the new buildings and their interiors use the unique textures added by this mod (requires the original CoB to be installed! https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45324). DO NOT ACTIVATE "City of Balmora.ESP" AND "WhiteSuran2_MD_Edition.esp" TOGETHER.
Note: this is a patch for version 1.12

---01 Temple Master Patch
This patches the plugin to remove the changes to the temple interior. You will need to use the patch included with Temple Master as well to use the two mods together.

---02 Patch for Vurt's Trees
If you have Vurt's Ascadian Isles II installed, consider using WhiteSuran2_patch_vurt.esp to alleviate some bleeding present otherwise (requires WhiteSuran2_MD_edition.esp)

---03 Suran Underworld 3 Patch
If you use Suran Underworld 3, activate WhiteSuran2_Suran Underworld Addon.esp to make the abandoned house and other interior edits in Suran use the unique textures added by this mod (requires WhiteSuran2_MD_edition.esp and Suran_Underworld_v3.ESP)

---04 Glow in the Dahrk
If you use Glow in the Dahrk, this patch will make the windows and temple windows turn on and off properly.
