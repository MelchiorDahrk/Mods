 Corgi Companion
=============================
by Melchior Dahrk

In December 2015, I held a Follower Appreciation Event through my Tumblr blog in which the Grand Prize was a mod of your choosing for Morrowind. The grand prize winner, m-l-helena, requested a Corgi Companion mod.

This mod adds a corgi companion to Morrowind made by me. The companion functionality is based off of Emma and Grumpy's work and the base for the texture I used was created by Nivea. The corgi, named Dinky by request, is a fully functional companion. You may now enjoy countless hours exploring Vvardenfell and beyond with this lovable pet and friend.

=============================
 Playing the Plugin
=============================
To get the new doggy companion, travel to the Andus Tradehouse in Maar Gan and talk to Manse Andus, the publican (take the Silt Strider from Ald-ruhn).

Dinky will level with you, increasing its health, fatigue, and strength
Dinky will not carry your crap for you
Dinky has been made "essential" like in Skyrim. This means that unless he suffers an insanely strong attack, he will be knocked unconcious rather than die. You will then have to wait 15 seconds until he revives. When he revives, he will have 50% of his max health restored. You will need to either rest or give Dinky some potions to restore his health to 100%.
Dinky will be pretty weak at level 1 but he'll quickly grow into a tough little corgi. Check the "-Status" dialogue to see what his stats will be at your next level.

Topics:
-Follow : Give instructions to Dinky
-Health : Give health potions to Dinky (note: this becomes less useful as Dinky grows stronger - at which point, he probably won't need much healing anyway)
-Rat meat : Dinky LOVES rat meat!
-Status : Check on Dinky's current and next-level health and strength
-Stay Outside : Instruct Dinky to remain outdoors when you enter an interior cell
-Your dog : Talk to NPCs about Dinky. You might just learn some things about him.


=============================
 Installation
=============================
To install first, decide if you want Dinky to be essential (non-killable) or non-essential (doggy murderer!) copy all files from the selected version into the Data Files directory and activate the included .esp file.


=============================
 Incompatibilities
=============================
