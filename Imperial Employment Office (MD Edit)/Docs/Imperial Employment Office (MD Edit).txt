Imperial Employment Office (MD Edit)

Version 4.0.1


Mod Description
====================================
This mod creates a new, joinable faction in Morrowind - the Imperial Employment Office (IEO). There are a lot of commoners in Vvardenfell who aren't strong fighters or skilled mages. The IEO is there to give them jobs as well. This mod is mostly aimed towards role-players as the jobs are usually quite straight-forward and not too challenging (with one optional exception which does involve some combat).

The IEO can be found in "Vivec, Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks", and gives you day-to-day jobs with payments. As you progress through the faction, you will get jobs that requires more skills and trust. Ultimately, you can become the leader of the Office and get a weekly payment. As the head honcho, you'll also be able to improve your income and the services of the office by approving jobs for your new underlings.


Background from MD
====================================
I was busily installing mods, when I got distracted by one in particular: Imperial Employment Office. This mod caught my eye. It seemed like a cool concept but I wanted to check out how well it was implemented. At the very outset, the one cell added by the mod was pretty bad with bright lighting and floaters everywhere. After closer inspection I found numerous things which should be fixed (the mod needed a thorough proofreading) and several which were driven by personal preference. I then proceeded to stay up until 3AM making various changes to the mod itself... so here I am.

You can find the original mod here: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/27246/?

The bottom line is that the concept behind this mod is a cool one and so I wanted to bring it up to date with today's standards and clean up old issues.

I hope you enjoy!


Comments on 3.0.0+ releases
====================================
My edits to IEO were previously hosted on my Dahrk Mods page. However, the 3.0.0 update is a massive overhaul of the mod. Touching every single quest. Expanding the questline. Adding brand new assets. Utilizing OAAB_Data assets where sensible. Along with tons of fixes and improvements all around.

With that said, it seemed like a good time to give the mod its own dedicated page so that it'd have better visibility and be easier to track issues and suggestions.


Compatibility
====================================
For BCoM users, make sure that you enable the patch for this mod which is included in BCoM to make sure that the office is accessible. Otherwise, the two mods should be compatible (see comment below about the included Seyda Neen Lighthouse patch).


Installation
====================================
Use the included fomod if you use a mod installer like MO2. The archive is also set up in a BAIN compatible format for use with Wrye Mash. For manual installation, you'll need to choose the options you want from each folder.

The Seyda Neen Lighthouse Patch is for use with mods that expand the footprint of the light house such as BCoM, RandomPal's Seyda Neen, Lucevar's Seyda Neen, and N'wahs and Mushrooms Seyda Neen.

Changelog
====================================

Version 1.95.00b
- Fixed floating/bleeding objects (including most NPCs added by the mod)
- Redecorated IEO headquarters
- Proofread dialogue/journal entries
- Fixed broken dialogue responses and proofread (I might have missed some dialogue results, so people should   pay attention to mod-breaking bugs when I release)
- Fixed various NPC naming inconsistencies
- Replaced nearly all instances of IEO with Imperial Employment Office (I just have a thing against abbreviations in Morrowind, in most cases)
- Minor dialogue and journal tweaks for greater clarity (a preferential change, rather than a correction - done for continuity and helpfulness)
- Removed Pierre Voisins from Piernette's Farmhouse (it seemed strange with him in there... since I considered him more of a hired hand than a consort. He now stands outside, milling about)
- Changed Aniwen into a Dark Elf named Vulyn (and updated her dialogue accordingly) since she's in a temple robe at a Dunmer temple... (Altmer just don't worship ALMSIVI, face the facts of reality) 
- Removed Augustus' armor (the primary quest giver) - he's a government worker, not a soldier
- Disabled Balerius initially so that he won't be distracting during CharGen (also replaced his Ashlander shirt with something more appropriate)
- Replaced the chest of drawers in the office which was filled with glass armor
- Changed the Chiefs of Information from Guards to Agent classes (just cause...)
- Deleted a merchant which appears in a seemingly random location after achieving the highest rank in the IEO. He had a chest full of powerful items including daedric and glass... and seemed like more of a cheat than a feature
