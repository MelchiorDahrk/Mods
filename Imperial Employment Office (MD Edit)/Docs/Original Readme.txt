Description
===========
This mod creates a new, joinable faction in Morrowind - the Imperial Employment Office. 
There is a lot of commoners in Vvardenfell that aren't strong fighters or epic mages, 
and I figured the Imperials would see the need to give them some jobs as well. This mod is
mostly aimed towards roleplayers as the jobs are usually quite straight-forward and not too
challenging. I have tried to make them slightly varied, though, and hope people will enjoy it.

The Office can be found in Vivec, Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, and gives you 
day-to-day jobs with payments. As you progress through the faction, your will get 
a raise and jobs that requires more skills and more trust. Finally you can become 
the leader of the Office and get a weekly payment from the Empire. 

There is also a secret, little reward for climbing all the way to the top in this mod...
