1. DESCRIPTION
===============

This mod takes several community resources as well as my own work and adds many new types of creatures (and associated loot) to the game.

Bone Golem: This fleshless undead golem will directly damage your health with it's Deathbloom spell.
Flesh Atronach: The equivalent of a Poison Atronach, this daedra was featured in TES4: Shivering Isles. 
Iron Atronach: This atronach has no spellcasting ability but resists shock and is immune to poison. Choose your spells carefully.
Swamp Myconid: Found in the Bitter Coast Region, this strange creature is the weakest of them all, but don't take it too lightly...
Telvanni Myconid: Created from the minds of powerful wizards, these creatures are a formidable foe.
Ash Golem: The Ash Golem is often summoned by powerful Mabrigash to ward off unwanted attention.
Crystal Golem: This animated mass of wizard crystal is a foe to be reckoned with.

===============
2. Requirements
===============

Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, OAAB_Data, and Tamriel_Data

========================
3. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN
========================

Mod comes packaged with a fomod installer.

00 Core - Required files.
01 Summon Spell Shop (MWSE) - Adds a new shop outside the gates of Tel Branora where you can buy summoning spells. REQUIRES MWSE AND MAGICKA EXPANDED.
02 Leveled Creatures Additions - Adds the new creatures to leveled lists. REQUIRES MERGING LEVELED LISTS.

===============
5. SAVE GAMES
===============

Updating to 4.00+ from any previous versions requires a new save.

6. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ERRORS

Anything which places a building in the exact same spot as the Spell Boutique.

And if you are using "Atronach Expansion_LeveledLists.esp", then also use a leveled list merger to avoid conflicts.
