Sword of the Kagouti King
by Melchior Dahrk & Rubberman

Help reforge the long lost sword of the legendary Kagouti King. This figure of myth wielded an extraordinary blade moulded in the likeness of his namesake. And you will be the next bearer of the sword after you help an attention hungry weaponsmith achieve his dream of reforging it.

The mod includes a sheath for the weapon if you use Weapon Sheathing and a small book hinting at the sword's illustrious history.

Changelog:
1.0 - Initial release
1.1 - Fixed some typos. Improved placement of mould. Cleaned plugin.
2.0 - Clarified some dialogue. Remodeled the stalhrim shavings. Fixed dialogue filter which could give anyone the "weapon of legend" topic. Fixed dialogue filtering on a "stalhrim" topic to be for Yagak instead of the guide. Added some more dialogue steps while Yagak is reforging the sword to deal with possible dialogue loops. Stalhrim shavings are now distributed into the game rather than requiring a chisel (removes MWSE requirement)
