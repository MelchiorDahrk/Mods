Sword of the Kagouti King
by Melchior Dahrk & Rubberman
Version 1.1

Help reforge the long lost sword of the legendary Kagouti King. This figure of myth wielded an extraordinary blade moulded in the likeness of his namesake. And you will be the next bearer of the sword after you help an attention hungry weaponsmith achieve his dream of reforging it.

The mod includes a sheath for the weapon if you use Weapon Sheathing and a small book hinting at the sword's illustrious history.

Playing the plugin:
To start the quest, listen to the Latest Rumors in Mournhold.
If you have TR_Preview and TR_Travels_(Preview_and_Mainland) activated, then you can walk from Mournhold to Dun Akafell to complete the quest. Otherwise, you can use the new guide NPC I added to Plaza Brindisi Dorom.
