by Melchior Dahrk
for the 2023 Winter ModJam

Themes: Dangers of Vvardenfell - Sea of Ghosts - Birds of a Feather Flock Together

A scientific expedition headed into the Sea of Ghosts has failed to report on their progress. An investigator from the Imperial Navy has been dispatched to locate the White Wave and is looking for a hand. Join his crew to unravel what happened to the White Wave in the frozen northern waters...

Playing the plugin:
Talk to Devos Artarian at the Dagon Fel docks.


Features:
Explore a frozen iceberg zone in the Sea of Ghosts
Unravel the mystery of the White Wave
Voiced lines from the new characters
Earn a unique keepsake at the end of the quest


Compatibility
Temporarily adds a ship to Dagon Fel but it is removed when the quest starts. May conflict with any mods which move the Dagon Fel docks location.

Note that the galleon and cutter sets included in this mod are free to use but will be properly included in the next OAAB_Data update with additional fixes. This mod will be updated at that time to no longer include those assets.

This mod has been playtested in both the vanilla (MGE XE, MWSE, MCP) and OpenMW engines.
