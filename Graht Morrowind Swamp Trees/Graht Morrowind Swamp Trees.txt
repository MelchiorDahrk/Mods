Graht Morrowind Swamp Trees (GMST)
by Melchior Dahrk

Description
==================================
This mod adds enormous trees to the Bitter Coast region to provide a dense canopy overheard and large roots jutting out of the ground below. This mod is mostly eye candy in nature. I don't consider this a "realistic" take on what the Bitter Coast should look like. I've tried my best to optimize the tree meshes (fully split up collision meshes), but they are big and have a ton of leaf planes each, so don't expect this to increase your FPS.

I recommend using this with Vality's Bitter Coast mod (http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-11539) to enhance the tree density. Even if you don't use Vality's trees, you can install something like Vurt's Bitter Coast after Vality's and you'll end up with a denser swamp if you use the plugin in Vality's mod.


Installation
==================================
00 Core - required files
01 Matching Vanilla Trees --- Modifies vanilla trees to match the leaves and textures of the new Graht trees.
01 Matching Vanilla Trees - Ashfall --- Install this instead if you use Ashfall.
02 Vality BC Patch --- Updates Vality's ESP to not place so many trees around the Seyda Neen lighthouse. Use this plugin instead of Vality's original.
03 Cawumaloe Manor --- is a patch for the old Cawumaloe Manor house mod which moves it high above the canopy of the new trees. Nice little place to view the leafy landscape (does not require the original mod)
04 Tamriel Rebuilt Sundered Scar Region --- adds the large trees to the TR Sunder Scar Region
05 Nevena's Twin Lamps Patch --- is based on l1lartur0's fixed version and moves the Seyda Neen Slave Hunter base so it's not in a tree. Use this ESP INSTEAD of "Nevena's Twin Lamps & Slave Hunters_Edited.esp". Requires assets from the original mod. DO NOT USE BOTH.
06 OAAB Saplings --- patch to make the OAAB saplings use the textures from this mod for visual consistency
07 Platforms and Walkways --- Adds platforms and walkways to the upper boughs of the graht trees (incompatible with Shaht Trees)
07 Shaht Trees --- Use this if you are not a fan of verticality (incompatible with Platforms and Walkways)
08 HD Textures --- Provides 4x vanilla resolution textures
09 The Sable Dragon Patch (Plugin Replacer) --- Plugin replacer for The Sable Dragon which moves it for compatibility with both this mod and Hla Odai.

If using the "GMST Vality's Bitter Coast Addon.esp", it should load before other Bitter Coast mods since it does make landscape edits (adding vertex colors).

Changelog
==================================
v1.0.0 - Initial release
v1.1.0 - Repackaged mod
v1.2.0 - Improved the UV of the tree trunk/branches to have more consistent texel density
v2.0.0 - The Graht Swamp Trees now have static leaves (way less draw calls than before for better performance and render better in Distant Land). Broke up collision meshes on the vanilla trees and large rope bridges to improve performance. Added giant tree stumps and logs. Modified the root connection at the base of the trees to look more natural. Added trees to the area near Seyda Neen. Includes a patched version of Vality's Bitter Coast which clears the area around the Seyda Neen lighthouse and other problematic placements. Docked the patched Cawumaloe Manor at the treetop walkways. Reduced clipping and improved traversability of rope bridge walkways. Edited the leaves textures to behave better with Distant Land. Added an optional mod to add the new trees to the Sunder Scar Region on the TR mainland. Added patch for Xen-Arien's Manor.
