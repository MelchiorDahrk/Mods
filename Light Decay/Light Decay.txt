Light Decay
by Greatness7 & Melchior Dahrk

Description
This mod provides a subtle, immersive, and useful visual signal for when a light source in the player's hand is about to run out: the radius of the light will begin to diminish and eventually go out when the light extinguishes.


Requirements
MWSE


Credits
